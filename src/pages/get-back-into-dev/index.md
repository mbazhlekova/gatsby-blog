18 months ago I joined the dark side.

I left development to be a project manager.

My first development job was at a company that didn't value development. There was no mentorship, limited learning opportunities and bad practices. I left for management because I thought I didn't like software engineering. In retrospect, I needed a change of environment.

The business side of tech had interested me for a while and I took an opportunity when it presented itself. At first I enjoyed the new challenges and problems to solve. I still spend a lot of time thinking and reading about process improvements. But, it became clear that management wasn't for me.

### Why I went back

I was working as a PM at a startup with a decent engineering culture. The developers were passionate and eager to learn and experiment. Their passion rubbed off on me and I got excited about coding again. I missed creating things instead of removing obstacles for other people. I was working long hours and busy all day but didn't feel a sense of accomplishment when I went home. Most days I would be falling asleep thinking "what did I even do today?" I wasn't having fun. Seeing an idea from start to finish is what I find satisfying. I didn't get that from management.

Earlier this year I got the news that my role was being cut after the company lost a major client. It was time to dedicate myself completely to my goal of working as a software developer again.

### My advice for getting back into dev

Even though I was only out of dev for a year, this advice will work for those that have been out for longer too.

First, don't panic.

Things in tech change fast and it will seem like you've fallen so far behind that you'll never catch up. But you will. It will suprise you to see how much you still remember (and how much you've forgotten).

It will be hard and seem impossible. It's not. If I can do this, you can do this.

This is the path I followed to refresh my coding skills and work as a developer again.

#### Make a plan

You need to get into the mindset of a programmer again. The best (and worst) thing about coding is how many learning resources are out there. It's easy to jump from resource to resource never actually learning anything.

You need to make a plan.

I used [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) because it already had a plan laid out for me. I started at the beginning and pretended I was learning to code for the first time.

I start reading developer blogs and news again to figure out how much things had changed. I'm a JavaScript developer. Angular.js was the hot new thing when I started my career and now everyone had moved onto this React thing and ES6. It didn't look like the JavaScript I knew. Since I approached everything as a beginner, I eased myself in to learning ES6 and React. I work with React daily now but I felt like it was something I would never be able to learn 8 months ago.

Read everything about the languages and tools you plan to use. Figure out what versions, libraries and frameworks are being used now. Make a plan to learn them.

#### Seek out a community

Things will get hard. Having a community of fellow learners helps keep you going through those hard times. There aren't many groups for those in our situation so I sought out those for new programmers. I discovered the [Chingu Cohorts](https://chingu-cohorts.github.io/chingu-directory/) through the FreeCodeCamp forums. It was instrumental in my journey. When things felt too hard I would check out the Slack channel and it would motivate me to keep going. It even helped me a lot in dealing with my unexpected job loss.

Immerse yourself.

I also joined Meetup and started attending different user groups once a week until I found the ones I liked. I recommend this for all developers. It's a great opportunity to network, eat free pizza and learn new things.

#### Prep for interviews

Break out [Cracking the Coding Interview](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1512861371&sr=8-1&keywords=cracking+the+coding+interview) and start practicing writing code on a whiteboard. Read about different companies' interview processes. Write blog posts explaining different concepts . Find someone to help you practice interviews. I was spending every weekend reviewing data structures and algorithms.

#### Get a job (any job)

I wasn't hearing back from any jobs since my last position wasn't technical. I worked with a recruitment agency that placed me in a 3 month contract as an Angular.js dev. It wasn't ideal but having that as my most recent experience made a big difference in finding my next job. I was now hearing back from more companies after having a recent software position on my resume. Freelancing or contract work can help a lot in finding that permanent role.

#### Continue learning

Finally, never stop learning again. Even after landing a permanent position, strive to be a better developer than you ever were. It's not easy to succeed in this field if you don't stay on top of things. I don't want to feel obsolete or left behind again.
I'm following this [guide](https://github.com/P1xt/p1xt-guides/blob/master/cs-wd.md) from P1xt in the Chingu Cohorts. No matter where you are in your career, you could learn something from one of these resources.

Following these steps I was able to work as a software developer again and land a job that I love.

No matter how many years it's been since you wrote code for a living, I promise that you can do it again.
